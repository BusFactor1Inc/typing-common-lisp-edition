Typing - Common Lisp Edition
---

Here you will find the source to 'Typing - Common Lisp Edition', a
game of skill, speed and accuracy written in Common Lisp.

This is meant to be an example of a quick and dirty game that can be
made easily using Lispworks and CAPI, and also as an exampe on how to
package an codesign LispWorks generated binaries for inclusion in the
macOS AppStore.

It was developed with LispWorks, and thus, requires it to build
and run. Hobby editions are available at http://lispworks.com/.

Sounds have not been included, but the code to load them is still there.

Replace the xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx's in build.sh with your developer
certificate values to enable codesigning.

Purchase "Typing - Common Lisp Edition" at the macOS AppStore:
